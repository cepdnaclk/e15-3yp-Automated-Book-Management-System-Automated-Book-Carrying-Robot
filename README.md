## Introduction

In libraries, We have planned to implement a book carrying robot to help the workers.Our embedded system will have Arduino,IR sensors,DC motors,power batteries and voltage regulator etc.It will work as a line following robot.Wi-fi module is used to communicate with a robot.We use RFID tag for books to use a web application,a database and a server to store the book details as well as the location details about the book shelfs for each and every book.

## Solution Architecture

* Making an automated book picking robot to help the workers in the library.
* The robot saves time and reduces human effort.
* It reduces human error and manages the books in an efficient and effective way.
* It is always available in the library.
* It is reliable.
* It ensures the security of the library and keeps the book safe.
